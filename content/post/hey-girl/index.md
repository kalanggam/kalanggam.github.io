hey girl,  
you remind me  
that i have two hearts,  
two kasingkasings whose beats sing  
for you, for me, for us, for we,  
brown girls and brown queers, who rise  
like the sun after gentle rains and eastward winds.  

hey girl,  
you remind me  
of the south plains sky,  
stretched wide over the lands,  
colonized, where we rebelliously learned  
to thrive, to live, to flourish, to give  
to all society's cast aside, all who have lived and died  
and will live again on the breath of justice.  

hey girl,  
you remind me  
that we have high hopes,  
manifested destinies and techniques  
to achieve all the dreams, at first unimaginable  
by our ancestors, by our lovers, by our oppressors, by our detractors,  
culturally rich and getting richer, immeasurable  
like the grains of rice from the eons harvested over paddies.  

hey girl,  
you remind me  
that our words are more powerful  
than any fist, any sword, any bomb, any gunâ€”  
that our hearts beat louder than any boots, drums, or speakers.  
you remind me that our spirits fight harder  
for love and for liberation, for life and for nation.  

hey girl,  
you reminded me  
to stay connected even over sea,  
to practice my meditations and see the unseen.  
you reminded me to fight  
until we are all free.
